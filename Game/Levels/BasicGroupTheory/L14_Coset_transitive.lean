Introduction "
Let H be a subgroup of G.

Every left coset g • H is an H-orbit under the right translation action:
Let x ∈ g • H. If y is also in g • H, then there is an element h ∈ H such that x * h = y.  Since `h = x⁻¹ * y`, it means `x⁻¹ * y ∈ H`.
The reverse direction is also true.
We now prove this.

Later we call this
`Subgroup.mem_coset_iff_diff_mem_subgroup`

  Hint "Use `constructor` to split the goals. "

  · intro hy
    Hint "Use `mem_leftCoset_iff` to translate
    x ∈ g • H into g⁻¹ x ∈ H. "
    Hint "Note that x⁻¹ * y = (g⁻¹ * x)⁻¹ * (g⁻¹ * y).
    You can use `have
    have hxy :x⁻¹ * y = (g⁻¹ * x)⁻¹ * (g⁻¹ * y) := by group` to establish this claim.

    Hint "If `a ∈ H`, `b ∈ H`, then `a⁻¹ * b ∈ H`. This is Subgroup.mem_of_inv_mul_mem"

  · Hint " Since x ∈ g • H, we have g⁻¹ x ∈ H.
    Therefore, that `y = x * (x⁻¹ * y) = g * ((g⁻¹ * x) * (x⁻¹ * y)) ` for some h∈H.  "
    Hint "We start to execute the above argument with `intro hxy`."
