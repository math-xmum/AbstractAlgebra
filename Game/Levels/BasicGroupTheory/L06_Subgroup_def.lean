Introduction "
A subgroup of a group $G$ is a nonempty subset $H$ of $G$ such that $*$ is closed under $H$ and inverse.

We have a criterion for a set H to be a subgroup of $G$:
If H is non-empty and a ∈  H ∧ b ∈  H implies a * b⁻¹ ∈ H
then H is a subgroup of G

The follow theorem this criterion.

lemma And.intro' (h1 : P) (h2 : P→Q) : P ∧ Q := ⟨h1, h2 h1⟩

/--
Suppose you want to proof proposition R using `mk'.
So one have to prove proposition P and Q respectively.
This magical lemma allows one assume P holds when proving Q.

lemma mk.intro {h1 : P} {h2 : P→Q} (mk : P → Q → R) : R := mk h1 (h2 h1)

/--
Instead of proving H satisfies the conditions to be a subgroup of G separately, this lemma allows one prove the conditions step by step such that using the result already proved before.
