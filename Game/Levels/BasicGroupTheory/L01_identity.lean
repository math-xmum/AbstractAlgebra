Introduction "
Suppose $G$ is a set with a binary operation $*$.

The following statement claims that identity element is unique.

Suppose $e$ and $e'$ are two identity elements, we need to prove $e=e'$.

variable (G :Type*) [Mul G]


Introduction "This statement proves the uniqueness of the identity element in a group. It shows that if both $e$ and $e'$ satisfy the properties of an identity element (left and right multiplication), then they must be equal."

Statement (e e' : G) (h1: ∀ g : G, e * g = g) (h2: ∀ g : G, g * e = g) (h3: ∀ g : G, e' * g = g) (h4: ∀ g : G, g * e' = g) : e = e' := by
  Hint "We need to show that the two identity elements {e} and {e'} are equal. Start by using hypothesis {h1} with {e'} as the argument."
  rw [<- h1 e']
  Hint "Now our goal is $e = e * e'$. To simplify the right side, we can use hypothesis {h4} with {e} as the argument, which states that $e * e' = e$."
  rw [h4 e]

Conclusion "Note: The proof doesn't actually use `h2` or `h3`, but they're part of the symmetric definition of identity elements. The annotations focus on the tactics actually used in the proof.
