Introduction "
Let H be a subgroup of G.
The subset g • H := {gh | h∈H} for some g∈G is called a left coset of H.

We first prove the simple fact that
x ∈ g • H ↔ g⁻¹ * x ∈ H

The above lemma is called `mem_leftCoset_iff' in Mathlib.

    Hint "Note that x ∈ g • H means ∃ h: G,  h ∈ H ∧  g * h = x. Use `obtain' to obtain the anxiety element h.
    For example, one can use
    `obtain ⟨h, hh1,hh2⟩ := h1'

    obtain ⟨h, hh1,hh2⟩ := h1
