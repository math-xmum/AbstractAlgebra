Introduction "
Let H be a subgroup of G.

Every left coset g • H is an H-orbit under the right translation action:
Let x ∈ g • H. If y is also in g • H, then there is an element h ∈ H such that x * h = y.  Since `h = x⁻¹ * y`, it means `x⁻¹ * y ∈ H`.
The reverse direction is also true.
We now prove this.

Later we call this
`Subgroup.mem_coset_iff_diff_mem_subgroup`
