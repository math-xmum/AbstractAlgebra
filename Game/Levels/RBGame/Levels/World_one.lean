World "World_One"
Title "World One"

Introduction "Welcome to tutorial world! In this world we learn the basic definition and property of group, and try to prove some relevant theorems.The boss level of this world is to prove: In the additive group ZMod n, -x is the right inverse of x. At the same time, we will understand the essence of the Rubik's cube from the perspective of group theory.

You prove theorems by solving puzzles using tools called tactics.
The aim is to prove the theorem by applying tactics in the right order.
Let's learn some basic concepts and tactics. Click on \"Start\" below to begin your quest."
