Introduction "
A subgroup N of G is called a normal subgroup if
∀ g n, n ∈ N → g*n*g⁻¹ ∈ N.

We will show that N is normal if and only if the multiplication of any two left cosets is still a left coset.

In this case, the equation (g • N) * (h • N) = (g*h) • N must holds since g*h is in (g • N) * (h • N).

By this property,
we see that
the map G → Set G sending g to gN is a monoid homomorphism, whose image is the set G/N of left cosets of N.
We call π : G → G/N canonical  group homomorphism.
