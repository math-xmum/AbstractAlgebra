Introduction "
This universal property characterizes the quotient group in the following sense:
any pairs (Q, π : G →* Q) satisfying the following properties are canonically isomorphic to each other:

(*1) N ≤ ker π
(*2) For any group homomorphism f : G →* H such that f(N) = 1, there exists a unique homomorphism f' : Q →* H such that f' ∘ π = f.

In this section, we will prove this claim.

Note that in the previous level, we established that the pair (G/N, π : G →* G/N) satisfies the universal property (*), i.e., the quotient group exists.

    We unpack the ExistsUnique claim {HP} to get a group homomorphism toFun : P→*Q. Here is a ticky point: one can not use `obtain` to unpack. Since `obtain` is for proof manipulation only,
    i.e. when the goal is a proposition.
      In our case, the goal is a multiplicative equivalence, which is not a proposition.

      The solution is to use the axiom of choice to pick the element.
      Try
      `let toFun := Classical.choose HP`

    Hint "Now use `Classical.choose_spec` to extract the assertion that the function {toFun} satisfies the property `{toFun} ∘ ⇑piP = ⇑piQ`.
    This is the first part of the ExistsUnique claim {HP}. One can use
    `have HtoFun := (Classical.choose_spec HP).1`
