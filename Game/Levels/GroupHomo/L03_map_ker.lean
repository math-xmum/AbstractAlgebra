Introduction "
Let  f : G →* H be a group homomorphism.
Then the kernel of f is defined by

Ker(f) := {g ∈ G | f(g) = 1}

It is easy to see that Ker(f) is a subgroup of G.
But Ker(f) satisfies one additional property:

∀ g ∈ G, x ∈ Ker(f),  g x g⁻¹ ∈ f
We now prove this property.

A subgroup satisfies the above property is called a normal subgroup of G.

Note that, if G is Abelian, then g x g⁻¹ = x ∈ Ker(f) for all x ∈ Ker(f), i.e. all subgroups of G are normal.
But this is not the case for general groups.
